# Pac-Man API <img width="48" height="48" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/java/java-original-wordmark.svg" />

This repository is the Java backend server for my solo Pac-Man project. This API connects to both MongoDB and Redis databases to store and retrieve user account and score data respectively.

The client application that pairs with this API can be found at https://github.com/jmcnally17/pacman-client

The JS Express version of this API (deployed version) can be found at https://github.com/jmcnally17/pacman-api-js

The original project monolith (with a full comprehensive commit history) can be found at https://github.com/jmcnally17/pacman-old

### Technologies Used

- [Trello](https://trello.com/) for monitoring feature progress
- [Render](https://render.com/) for deployment
- [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) and [Redis Labs](https://redis.com/) for hosting the databases
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) for version control

## Running Locally

This API can be run on your localhost in conjunction with the client application. However, a number of frameworks need to be installed which requires some setup to do.
